This project shows a custom-built website featuring some information about myself as well as a form about one
of my favorite hobbies: Skiing! It also features links to the WPI homepage and a link to a website about
top ski resorts in new England.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for numerous classes and selectors all of which can be viewed in the stylesheet.
- **Javascript Animation**: I added a simple javascript animation where my name and the title of the ski form rotate through various colors.
- **Semantic HTML Tags**: Experimented with links, header, footer, main, and section

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Inter Font from Google Fonts**: I used Inter as the font for any <p> tags on the website.
